    <p>The social media ranks</p>

       <h1><a href="https://instagram.com">1.Instagram: </a>Instagram is very strict about fake accounts and they make sure that your brand name gets a verified sign so that people can identify the brand they love so much. It is important to have a presence on all social media platforms, but if you are contemplating your SMM plan for 2018, then Instagram should be on the top of your list.</h1>

        <h1><a href="https://web.telegram.org/">2.Telegram: </a>To create an account with Telegram, you'll need one of its apps and a phone number. The service is free to set up and use. Like Editors' Choice winner Signal and other over-the-top messengers, Telegram requires a phone number that can receive SMS verification. I had no trouble creating and authorizing an account on my Android 11 phone, and even created a second account using my Google Voice number. I easily switched between both accounts from the Telegram Android app I used in testing. Telegram also offers apps for iOS, Linux, macOS, and Windows. You can use Telegram through a web portal, too, but you need to create your account with one of its mobile apps. </h1>
